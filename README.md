# An Algorithm for Passive Microwave Precipitation Retrievals: Transfer Learning from Reanalysis Data to Multi-satellite Observations using Boosted Decision Trees

This repository represents the development of an algorithm, called the Boosted tRansfer-leArning for PMW precipitatioN Retrievals(B-RAINS). The algorithm relies on integrating the information content from Earth System Models (ESMs)
into the retrieval process and allows the fusion of multi-satellite observations across varying spatial and temporal resolutions through meta model learning. The algorithm first detects the precipitation phase and then estimates its rate,
while conditioning the results to some surface and surface type variables.
