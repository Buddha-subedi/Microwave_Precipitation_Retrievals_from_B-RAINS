    "<p align=\"justify\"> This notebook representes the results of an algorithm, called the Boosted tRansfer-leArning for PMW precIpitationN Retrievals (B-RAINS) for passive microwave retrieval of precipitation. B-RAINS enables (i) the integration of the information content from ESMs into the retrieval process and (ii) the fusion of multi-satellite observations across varying spatial and temporal resolutions through meta-model learning. The architecture leverages transfer learning by incorporating low-level priors from ESMs and refining them with high-level features derived from satellite-based active retrievals, enhancing accuracy in regions and periods with limited training data. The algorithm first detects the precipitation occurrence and phase and then estimates its rate, while conditioning the results to some key cloud microphysical and environmental variables as further explained later on in Section 1.2. Through ensemble meta-modeling, B-RAINS combines data from multiple spaceborne radars operating at Ka, Ku, and W bands to improve the detection of rainfall and snowfall. Application and validation using data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission and CloudSat's Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) show that B-RAINS achieves comparable accuracy to existing methods for rain retrievals and delivers substantial improvements in global snowfall estimates when benchmarked against version V07 of the official GPM data products and Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor System (MRMS) precipitation estimates over the contiguous United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized as follows. Section 1, describes the data including the GPM and CloudSat products as well as the ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Section 2 describes the methodolgy for training the networks, and the last section provides an example for precipitation orbital retrieval using the proposed algorithm."
